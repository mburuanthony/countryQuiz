I made this application as a submission to a challenge from [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges). The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/Bu3G2irnaXmfwQ8sZkw8) was to build an application to complete the given user stories provided with figma designs and an [api](https://restcountries.eu/) to work with. The user stories were quite difficult to implement but nonetheless achievable and successfully implemented.
